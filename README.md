# CSS-Crash-Course
This project is just the code that was used in the CSS Crash Course that I found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI). 
I am adding the notes I took during the crash course:
    
    CSS = cascading stylesheets
    not a programming language but a styling language
    used for website design, most commenly used with HTML
    can be extended with Sass or Less (using variables and so on)

    3 ways of adding css to a file
    - inline: directly in the html element (don't do this)
    - internal: using <style> tags within a single document (not as bad but also not recommended)
    - external: linking an external .css file

    The general rule is to seperate presentation, style and functionality

    We can use different colors in css
    - Color names(red, green, blue...)
    - HTML5 Color names(coral...)
    - Hexadecimal (#00ff00...)
    - rgb(0,0,255)


    In css you have web safe fonts (you don't have to import them) or you have others where you have to "import" their style

    As far as the browser is conserned, there is no great difference when it comes to id and class. 
    But what we as developers want to do is use id for something uniqe and use class for things that will not be.

    Padding is the space inside the border
    Margin is the space outside the border
    when applying margin with a short syntax we start at the top edge and move in the direction of the clock
